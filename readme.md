#Home Based Community App

Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com) Capstone project - Node JS, Express MongoDB with Passport Authentication

##Background
I have a couple of friends selling saplings, supply food, knit sweaters or stitch clothes and these people work from home. This application is beneficial for college students looking to make some money , stay at home moms or old energetic parents who want to provide some service. They don't take money for the job and they sometimes help people in need. So I created HBC for those people in lieu who want to turn their hobby into a profession and the person who is using their service doesnt have to pay them in terms of money but gift them with the wishlist item they have shared, so that its a service to help each other in a community and grow the community into a better place. 

##Use Case 
This app helps first find people with the niche skills who are willing to help others in times of need. 

##Initial UX and PRD
 The PRD and initial UX are in the below link (https://github.com/kattisarika/capstone-node-project/tree/master/PRD)


##Working Prototype 


##Functionality 
The app includes :

1. Registration Page 
2. Login Page
3. A Search functionality to list all the home scale business as per the zipcode. 
4. User can create , edit , delete their wishlist using the WishList page
5. Logout functionality

##Technical
The application is built on NodeJs,Express,MongoDB,PassportJS for authentication.The data is stored in mongoDB. Various api calls are made to fetch, store  and read data. 

##Development RoadMap
This is just the initial working prototype. More workflows would be added :-
1. A user can enter the service he would provide 
2. Search hides the email address. 
3. Wish list to be shared with a specific user 
4. Integration with Relevant work of the user, If they have a website, else need  a way to display the work of the user.
5. User to select and choose the wishlist item for which they would trade.
